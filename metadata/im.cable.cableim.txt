Summary:Private messenger
Description:
Cable is an encrypted communications application. It uses the Internet to
send one-to-one and group messages, which can include files, voice notes,
images and videos, and make one-to-one voice and video calls. Cable uses
standard cellular mobile numbers as identifiers, and uses end-to-end
encryption to secure all communications to other Cable users. The
applications include mechanisms by which users can independently verify
the identity of their messaging correspondents and the integrity of the
data channel.

Cable is a fork of the popular Signal messaging app. It and aims to rely
on a distributed, federated and community managed network of servers.

Cable has been freed from the proprietary dependencies Signal has,
it does not use Google's Play Services and does not rely on the Google
push notification service.
